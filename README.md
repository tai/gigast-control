GigaSt Control
======================
GigaSt is a series of DIY spectrum analyzer kit designed by Hideharu Aoyama, distributed from GigaSt website (http://www.wa.commufa.jp/gigast/). Latest version of the design is v5.

This project is an effort to support prior version - GigaSt v4.
It is not supported anymore and the software only runs on Windows - sometimes only with "Windows 98 emulation" mode.

Based on wxPython, this viewer/control app runs on all modern Windows/OSX/Linux.
